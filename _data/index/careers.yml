    detail: At IBM I designed and implemented an ETL process. This involved writing a design document outlining the requirements, specifications, and use cases of the customer, and relaying this information to an offshore team. We implemented the process using Automation Anywhere. I also had a neat experience working with the Skydio R1 drone, where, using OpenCV, Azure, and Power BI, I set up a Proof-Of-Concept warehouse inventory management system.
